# It's Zampl

Zampl (from the word "Example") is a site I use as a writer to test GitHub functionality and to get screenshots. The URL to view the rendered site is **[zampl.github.io](http://zampl.github.io)**.

There is a marketing software company called [Zample](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zampl/). This is not that company; the fact that we have the same name is just a coincidence.

Thank you for visiting.
